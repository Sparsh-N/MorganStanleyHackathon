An algorithm suffers from this problem when it cannot guarantee that a page will be kept when a small number of frames are available. An optimal algorithm would not suffer from this problem as it replaces the page not to be used for the longest time. The anomaly occurs when the page replacement algorithm will remove a page that will be needed in the immediate future. An optimal algorithm will not select such a page that will be required immediately. This anomaly is also stated to be unbounded.\n"}
